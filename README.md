# Lung-Cancer-Classification

## üìå Project Overview
Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection and progression monitoring are crucial for effective treatment and survival. Traditional diagnostic methods require medical expertise and imaging equipment, which can be time-intensive and resource-heavy.  

This project leverages **deep learning** to predict and simulate **lung cancer progression** using advanced neural network architectures. The approach includes:
- **CNN-based models (ResNet50, DenseNet121)** for feature extraction and classification from lung CT images.  
- **GAN-based framework** to simulate disease progression, helping visualize changes in cancer stages over time.  

The system aims to assist **medical professionals, researchers, and patients** by providing accurate predictions and disease progression visualization.
